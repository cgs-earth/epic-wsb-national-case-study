## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
accept_jsonld <- httr::add_headers("Accept" = "application/ld+json")

get_jsonld <- function(url) {rawToChar(httr::GET(url, config = accept_jsonld)$content)} 
u1 <- "https://geoconnex.us/ref/gages/1000001"
u2 <- "https://geoconnex.us/ref/gages/1000002"

j1 <- get_jsonld(u1) 
j2 <- get_jsonld(u2)

list <- list(j1,j2)

l2 <- paste0("[",list,"]",sep=",")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
