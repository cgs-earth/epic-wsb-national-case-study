## Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the value of the [National Water Service Area Boundary layer](https://www.policyinnovation.org/blog/water-boundaries-data) with a Federal government use case. This use case is to quantify the extent to which adding a drinking water quality-based indicator to the Climate and Environmental Justice Screening Tool would change the universe of "communities" (2010 Census Tract geographies) that are highlighted. This document describes the how to construct a binary indicator that corresponds to some drinking-water related risk, implements the indicator

## Defining a drinking water environmental justice indicator

The most common way to do this is to calculate an indicator variable based on drinking water violations data from the U.S. EPA SDWIS database. Here, I review and go over the pros and cons of the most common approaches in governance and the literature. First, some necessary terminology:

### Terminology

Violation

:   A violation of regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act

Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) Violation

:   When a concentration of a contaminant is detected to be above the limit allowed in drinking water standards.

Total Coliform Rule

:   A group of maximum contaminant levels and monitoring requirements for the presence of total coliform, fecal coliform, and *E. coli* bacteria.

Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level (MRDL) Violations

:   When a concentration of a disinfectant residual is detected to be above the limit allowed in drinking water standards.

Treatment Technique (TT) rule Violations

:   When specified treatment techniques required for a system's water source are not applied.

Health-based violations

:   Violations that are directly related to health risks in drinking water. Corresponds to all MCL, MRDL, and TT violations.

Monitoring and reporting (MR) violations

:   Failure to conduct drinking water quality tests or to submit the results of those tests in a timely fashion to USEPA or the primacy agency.

Other Violations

:   A USEPA catch-all category for other violations, which are generally either about conducting sanitary surveys of the system or about reporting their test results to the public or water systems they are interconnected with.

Compliance

:   Being in a state of not violating a relevant regulation

Compliance period

:   A period of time when a water system was in violation of a drinking water regulation

### Review of metrics

There are a few considerations in constructing a binary violation indicator:

1.  What types of violations count? MCL only? Health-based only? All?
2.  What contaminants should count in the case of MCL violations? Those monitored under the Total Coliform Rule? Lead and Copper Rule? Nitrates? All?
3.  How long does a violation need to last to be counted? 0 time? 1 month? 1 year?
4.  Over what time period do they count? The past year? 2 years? 5 years? Forever?

A brief review of the literature follows.

### Proposed metric

Binary indicator, which is if the system experienced more than 1 month in health-based violation in the past two years. Discussion can modify the month and year periods. I believe giving a grace period for 1 month over two years leaves room for true fluke events for utilities that otherwise have good process control. I can also simply create the metric for a few combinations and we can see what seems reasonable.

## Implementing the metric

First, we load required packages

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(mapview)
library(vroom)
library(qs)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)

sf_use_s2(FALSE)
```

Below, we describe and implement the workflow in R.

### Collate health-based violations with compliance periods ending March 2020 or later from SDWIS

First, we retrieve the .zip archive of the SDWIS data download from USEPA, and unzip the violations data table.

```{r}
#| eval: false
download.file(url = "https://echo.epa.gov/files/echodownloads/SDWA_latest_downloads.zip", destfile = "../data/sdwa.zip")
unzip("data/sdwa.zip", 
      files = "SDWA_VIOLATIONS_ENFORCEMENT.csv",
      exdir = "data")
```

This archive has several tables, the relevant one being `SDWA_VIOLATIONS_ENFORCEMENT.csv`, which as of this version of the workflow, was last updated on April 13, 2022.

```{r}
unzip("data/sdwa.zip", list = TRUE)
end_date <- as.Date(unzip("data/sdwa.zip", list = TRUE)$Date[11])
```

We load the violations table and filter to violations that end later than April 13, 2020, two years before the the most current data was released.

```{r}
start_date <- end_date - 365*2
violators <- vroom("data/SDWA_VIOLATIONS_ENFORCEMENT.csv", # read data
                    col_types = cols(.default = "c")) %>%
  filter(IS_HEALTH_BASED_IND == "Y") %>% # select only health-based violations
  mutate( #format dates as dates
    start = as.Date(COMPL_PER_BEGIN_DATE, 
                                   format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    end = pmin(as.Date(CALCULATED_RTC_DATE,
                                 format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
                              end_date)) # set end date to most current report date


  
  
```

### Calculate the number of days in health-based violation by each CWS within this period

```{r}
violators <- violators %>%
  mutate(
    violation_duration = end - start
  ) 
  
```

### Filter to CWS with greater than 30 such days

```{r}
violators <- violators %>%
  filter(end >= start_date) %>%
  filter(violation_duration >= 30) %>%
  distinct(PWSID)
```

### Filter the TEMM national water service boundary layer to those states with comprehensive, non-county-based Tier 1 boundaries, plus Utah

First we download and compress the TEMM layer for quick access in later parts of the workflow

```{r}
#| eval= FALSE
download.file(url = "https://www.hydroshare.org/django_irods/rest_download/6f3386bb4bc945028391cfabf1ea252e/data/contents/temm_layer_v1.0.0/temm.geojson/?url_download=True&zipped=False&aggregation=False", destfile = "data/temm.geojson")

temm <- sf::read_sf("data/temm.geojson")
qsave(temm, file = "data/temm.qs")

```

Now we load the file, and filter for only the states with comprehensive Tier 1 availability (AZ, CA, CT, KS, NJ, NM, OK, PA, TX, WA) as well as Utah for comparison. We also load in Utah's data for Culinwary Water Service Areas, filtering for Community Water Systems, which was not included in the original TEMM layer but has been created by Utah DWR, to compare performance between TEMM estimation methods and Tier 1 if possible.

```{r}
temm <- qread("data/temm.qs")
states <- c("AZ",
            "CA",
            "CT",
            "KS",
            "NJ",
            "NM",
            "OK",
            "PA",
            "TX",
            "UT",
            "WA")


utah <- sf::read_sf("https://services.arcgis.com/ZzrwjTRez6FJiOq4/arcgis/rest/services/CulinaryWaterServiceAreas/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&objectIds=&time=&geometry=&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&inSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&resultType=none&distance=0.0&units=esriSRUnit_Meter&returnGeodetic=false&outFields=*&returnGeometry=true&returnCentroid=false&featureEncoding=esriDefault&multipatchOption=xyFootprint&maxAllowableOffset=&geometryPrecision=&outSR=4326&defaultSR=&datumTransformation=&applyVCSProjection=false&returnIdsOnly=false&returnUniqueIdsOnly=false&returnCountOnly=false&returnExtentOnly=false&returnQueryGeometry=false&returnDistinctValues=false&cacheHint=false&orderByFields=&groupByFieldsForStatistics=&outStatistics=&having=&resultOffset=&resultRecordCount=&returnZ=false&returnM=false&returnExceededLimitFeatures=true&quantizationParameters=&sqlFormat=none&f=pgeojson") %>% filter(SYSTEMTYPE == "C")


boundaries <- temm %>% filter(
  state_code %in% states
) %>% select(-service_area_type_code)
```

### Filter the CEJST Census Tracts to the same states

First we download and unzip the data

```{r}
#| eval= FALSE
download.file(url = "https://static-data-screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/data-pipeline/data/score/shapefile/usa.zip", destfile = "data/j40.zip")
unzip("data/j40.zip", exdir = "data/j40")

```

Then we load it and the data dictionary

```{r}
j40 <- sf::read_sf("data/j40/usa.shp")
j40_dict <- vroom("data/j40/columns.csv")
```

### Filter to the resulting set of CWS with violations

```{r}
v <- boundaries %>% 
  filter(pwsid %in% violators$PWSID)
```

### Assign the indicator to CEJST Census Tracts that spatially intersect this set of CWS

First we spatially intersect the set of CWS boundaries with the threshold period of health-based violations to the CEJST version of the 2010 U.S. Census Tracts. We also do Utah separately. Caveats:

-   I am not setting a threshold for how large an overlap between a census tract and a utility needs to be. A census tract may have only a small portion covered by a utility and we are counting it. There are two scenarios:

    -   A relatively large system only serves part of a tract on its periphery

    -   A small system with a tier 1 boundary like a mobile home park or golf course community lies completely within a tract much larger than it

    -   I have not quantified this yet

```{r}
#| eval= FALSE
states2 <- c("Arizona",
            "California",
            "Connecticut",
            "Kansas",
            "New Jersey",
            "New Mexico",
            "Oklahoma",
            "Pennsylvania",
            "Texas",
            "Utah",
            "Washington")


j40 <- j40 %>% filter(
  SF %in% states2
)

v1 <- v %>% filter(state_code == states[1])
j1 <- j40 %>% filter(SF == states2[1])

v_j40 <- st_intersection(v1,j1)

for (i in 2:length(states)){
  v1 <- v %>% filter(state_code == states[i])
  j1 <- j40 %>% filter(SF == states2[i])
  v_j40_1 <- st_intersection(v1,j1)
  v_j40 <- bind_rows(v_j40,v_j40_1)
  print(paste0(i))
}


v_utah <- utah %>% filter(DWSYSNUM %in% v$pwsid)
j_utah <- j40 %>% filter(SF == "Utah")

v_j40_utah <- st_intersection(v_utah,j_utah)

qsave(v_j40,"data/viol_pws_j40.qs")
qsave(v_j40_utah, "data/viol_pws_j40_utah.qs")
```

Then, we need to construct indicator as framed by CEJST, meaning we assign to each Census tract a binary indicator as to whether it intersects a violating water system as well as meeting the socioeconomic threshold set by the CEJST (\>65th percentile for percentage of population living on incomes \<200% of the Federal Poverty line and with 80% or more of adults \>15 not enrolled in higher education). We also only allow for Tier 1 and Tier 2a matches, removing all Tier 2b and Tier 3 matches.

```{r}
states2 <- c("Arizona",
            "California",
            "Connecticut",
            "Kansas",
            "New Jersey",
            "New Mexico",
            "Oklahoma",
            "Pennsylvania",
            "Texas",
            "Utah",
            "Washington")


j40 <- j40 %>% filter(
  SF %in% states2
)

v_j40_utah <- qread("data/viol_pws_j40_utah.qs") 
v_j40 <- qread("data/viol_pws_j40.qs") %>% filter(tier == "Tier 1" | tier == "Tier 2a")

v_j40 <- v_j40 %>% filter(SF != "Utah")

j40_dw <- j40 %>% 
  mutate(
   DW = case_when(GEOID10 %in% v_j40$GEOID10 ~ "SDWA Violation Present",
                       TRUE ~ "SDWA Violation Not Present"), # DW indicator with Tier 2 Utah 
   DW_ut1 = case_when( ((GEOID10 %in% v_j40$GEOID10 & SF != "Utah") | (GEOID10 %in% v_j40_utah$GEOID10)) ~ "SDWA Violation Present",
                       TRUE ~ "SDWA Violation Not Present") # DW indicator with Tier 1 Utah
  )

j40_dw <- j40_dw %>%
  mutate(
    dw_disadv = (DW == 1 & M_EBSI == 1),
    dw_disadv_ut1 = (DW_ut1 ==1 & M_EBSI == 1)
  )
    

  
```

### Calculate and compare summary statistics for the original set of CEJST tracts (in the filtered states) and the new set, by state, including:

counts

Tract counts in selected states by Drinking Water indicator and current CEJST disadvantage status

```{r}
j40_dw <- j40_dw %>%
  mutate(
    CEJST_disadv = case_when(
      SM_C == 1 ~ "CEJST disadvantaged",
      TRUE ~ "Not CEJST disadvantaged"
    ), 
    CEJST_income_educ_threshold = case_when(
      M_EBSI == 1 ~ "CEJST 'low' inc/edu",
      TRUE ~ "CEJST 'high' inc/edu"
    )
  )
  x <-  j40_dw %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  tabyl(DW_ut1,CEJST_disadv) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row","col")) %>%
  adorn_percentages("col") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  adorn_ns() 
  
  kable(x)

  
```

-   Tract counts in selected states by Drinking Water indicator and current CEJST disadvantage status by State

    ```{r, results='asis'}
    j40_dw <- j40_dw %>%

      adorn_ns() %>%
      walk2(names(.), ~ print(kable(.x, caption = .y)))
    ```

-   Tract counts in selected states by Drinking Water indicator and current CEJST disadvantage status, by the CEJST non-student low-income socioeconomic indicator

```

-   total population

-   measures of income distribution

-   race/ethnicity population distributions

## Discussion

Will discuss results in detail here.

### Headline 1: 

959 "poor" tract/communities across the 11 states were identified to have safe drinking water violations, 67 of which were not previously identified as disadvantaged in the CEJST
